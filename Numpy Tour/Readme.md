<h1>NumPy<br></h1>

<h2>What is NumPy?<br></h2>
<p>- NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays.<br>

- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.<br>
- NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.<br>
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python.<br></p>

<h2>Why Use NumPy ?<br></h2>

<p>- In Python I have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.<br>
- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster that traditional Python lists.<br>
- The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.<br>
- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.<br></p>
